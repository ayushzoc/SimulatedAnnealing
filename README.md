# Simulated Annealing for Image Generation

Given a distorted image where the pixel columns of the images are randomized, Simulated Annealing is used to find the nearest distances between the columns to generate the final image. 

Simulated Annealing to solve the TSP is a very closely related problem with fewer dimensions.

## To run the program:
1. Clone/download the files from the git.
1. Install PIL, numpy, scipy, and matplotlib.
1. Run the SimulatedAnnealing_final.py.
1. You can provide a different distorted image. Rename the image as test.
1. Current testing image is of a mickey mouse. The final_image is the current best image provided by the program.
